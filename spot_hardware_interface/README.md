# spot_hardware_interface

This package provides a hardware interface for Spot using its [joint control API](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/concepts/joint_control/readme).

This plugin is used in the [`spot_ros2_control`](../spot_ros2_control/) package, which brings up both the hardware interface and some simple controllers in the ROS 2 control ecosystem.
